# Amazing_Numbers
The program analyzes numbers, entered by user. 
The instructions are as follows:
Welcome users;
Display the instructions;
Ask for a request;
If a user enters an empty request, print the instructions;
If the user enters zero, terminate the program;
If numbers are not natural, print the error message;
If an incorrect property is specified, print the error message and the list of available properties;
For one number, print the properties of the number;
For two numbers, print the properties of all numbers in the list;
For two numbers and two properties, print the list of numbers that contain the specified properties;
If a property is preceded by a minus, this property should not be present in a number;
If the user specifies mutually exclusive properties, abort the request and warn the user.
Once the request is processed, continue execution from step 3.
